how was your day?
I agree
I can't wait
I don't understand
I don't know
I feel great
I hope so
I love it
I need help
I see
I see what you mean
I'm good, thanks
I'm happy for you
I'm not sure
I'm ready
it's a good idea
it's all good
it's not a big deal
it's not funny
it's raining
it's really hot
it's my pleasure
it's nice to meet you
it's time to go
it's up to you
keep in touch
keep it up
let's go
let's see
let's talk
like I said
long time no see
look out
look at that
make it happen
make yourself at home
more or less
no big deal
no problem
no worries
not at all
not right now
not really
on the way
take care
take it easy
take it slow
talk to you later
that's a good idea
that's fine
that's it
that's okay
that's too bad
that's funny
that's strange
that's the way it is
the same here
think about it
try again
try your best
turn it off
turn it on
what do you think?
what's up?
what's going on?
what's new?
what's the matter?
where are you?
where are you from?
where have you been?
where should I go?
where to next?
wish you the best
with pleasure
wow, that's amazing
you are welcome
you can do it
you look great
you made it
you win
you’re welcome
excuse me
sorry to bother you
pardon me
I beg your pardon
I'm just looking
I don’t mind
I’m here for you
I’m so proud of you
I’m with you
I think so
I wish you well
I’m fine, thank you
it’s not your fault
it’s no big deal
it’s up to you
let me know
let’s meet soon
let’s stay in touch
that’s enough
that’s a relief
that’s great
thanks for your time
thanks a lot
thanks anyway
thanks for your help
thank you so much
thanks for everything
this is my first time
this is amazing
this is not fair
time is up
try again later
try not to worry
trust me
turn around
take your time
take care of yourself
take it or leave it
that’s the spirit
that’s what I mean
that sounds good
that’s just perfect
to be honest
to be fair
to be continued
to be honest with you
to be on the safe side
to make a long story short
we’ll see
we’re all in this together
we’re getting there
we’re good to go
well done
well played
what a relief
what a shame
what happened?
what should I do?
what’s the matter with you?
what’s the plan?
what’s the point?
what’s the time?
what’s wrong?
what’s your name?
what’s your opinion?
when’s the deadline?
where did you go?
where do you live?
where is it?
where to now?
who cares?
who’s there?
who’s going?
who’s calling?
why are you upset?
why don’t you try?
why not?
why’s that?
you can count on me
you got it
you’re on fire
you’re right
you’re not alone
you’re not listening
you’re so kind
you’re too kind
you’ve got this
you’ve made my day
you’ve lost me
you’ve got to be kidding me
your opinion matters
you’ve got to try this
your turn
no need to apologize
stay calm
stay positive
take a deep breath
do your best
don’t take it personally
don’t worry about it
don’t rush
don’t get ahead of yourself
give me a break
give it a try
give me a hand
go ahead
go back
go easy on me
go first
go home
go slow
hang on
hang tight
have a good one
have an awesome day
have fun with that
help yourself
how do you feel?
how does that sound?
how's everything going?
I agree with that
I agree totally
I can’t believe it
I didn’t mean to
I did my best
I feel so happy
I hope that’s helpful
I like that idea
I see your point
I think that’s enough
I’ll check that out
I’ll keep that in mind
I’m so excited
I’m not sure about that
I’m not in the mood
I’m on my way
I’m proud of you
I’m really busy
I’m sorry to hear that
I’m with you on this
it makes sense
it’s all right
it’s better than nothing
it’s no use
it’s not a big deal
it’s not the end of the world
it’s out of my hands
it’s so nice of you
it’s totally up to you
it’s your choice
it’s your decision
keep going
keep up the good work
keep your head up
let me think about it
let’s make a deal
let’s call it a day
let’s get started
let’s get together
let’s grab lunch
let’s hang out
let’s move on
let’s settle this
like I said before
look on the bright side
look out for each other
look forward to it
look who’s here
made up your mind?
make yourself comfortable
move forward
no biggie
no harm done
no worries at all
not that I know of
nothing to worry about
nothing is impossible
nothing is guaranteed
now or never
oh no, not again
one step at a time
on second thought
once in a while
put yourself in my shoes
raise your hand
relax a little
same here
see you later
settle down
share your thoughts
sorry about that
sorry for the inconvenience
sorry for being late
sorry I’m late
stop bothering me
stop it right now
take care of it
take the lead
talk to you soon
thank you very much
that’s a great idea
that’s amazing
that’s awesome
that’s fine with me
that’s no good
that’s so funny
that’s so sweet
that’s the last thing I need
the more the better
think it over
think of it as a challenge
this isn’t the time
this is a bit much
this is a no-brainer
this is going well
this is not happening
this is not the case
this is what I mean
this way please
time to go
time will tell
to tell the truth
totally agree
turn the page
we all make mistakes
we can work this out
we need to talk
we should catch up soon
what a day!
what’s wrong with this?
what’s the best option?
what’s the deal?
what’s your problem?
when will you be done?
when are you free?
when can we meet?
when did that happen?
when did you get here?
when in doubt, ask
where are you going?
where can I find this?
where do I sign?
where should we go?
who can help me?
who is that?
who’s the boss?
why is that happening?
why should I care?
why did that happen?
you always know how to cheer me up
you are awesome
you are so kind
you can say that again
you deserve it
you made my day
you mean a lot to me
you took the words right out of my mouth
you will be fine
you’re awesome
